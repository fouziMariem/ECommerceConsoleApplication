## Design Decisions
___
* We used the abstract class User as a parent class to the Admin class and Customer class .
* We added the sign in method to the customer to allow a new customer to use the application but an admin can be added only by another admin(thatâ€™s why we used the default admin when we first run the application).
* The user menu is an abstract method in user seeing that each type of users has its own features.
* To manage all the users we added a static attribute which is an array in which we store all users of the application.
* The inventory class manages all products in the inventory (add/remove etc).
* The class product is an abstract class and is parent to the classes : food/clothing/books/electronics.
* The shoppingCart class is used to manage the shopping cart of each user and do the checkout .
* The Order class is used to manage the orders and store the information of all orders in a static array.
* The paymentStategy interface is used to enforce a contract to all the classes that implements it (paypal payment/cash payment/ check payment/ credit card payment)
* The runApplication class is used run the whole application by creating an inventory and display the main menu then depending on the user displaying its menu .

## Optional features
___
* The coupons and discounts system.
* Shipping options.
1. The coupons and discounts system:
   * The discount code is set at first by the default admin .
   * Any admin can change it after.
   * The code apply to the shopping cart a discount of 10%.
2. Shipping options:
    * At the check out the user chooses the type of shipping.
    * The standard shipping adds 10 to the total price .
    * The Express shipping adds 20 to the total price.

## the design patterns
___
The Strategy design pattern is used in the PaymentSystem .
   * The PaymentStrategy class is an interface that has a method to pay .
   * The PayPalPayment class has a method to pay with paypal .
   * The CashPayment class has a method to pay with cash .
   * The CreditCardPayment class has a method to pay withthe credit card.
